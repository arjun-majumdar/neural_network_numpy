# neural_network_numpy
Implementation of a neural network from scratch using "numpy" and "TensorFlow 2.0" Python 3.X packages

A simple neural network having one hidden layer for binary classification of images of cats and dogs.
Coded completely using numpy (1.17.3), TensorFlow (2.0) and Python (3.7.4).

The hidden layer uses the following as it's activation function: either hyperbolic tangent function or ReLU function.
The output layer uses sigmoid activation function for performing binary classification.

"Neural_Networks_Backpropagation_Gradients" PDF file contains the mathematics which is required and used for coding up the neural network

The files :

1.) "neural_network_one_hidden_layer.py" contains implementation of neural network using 'numpy'

2.) "neural_network_one_hidden_layer_tensorflow.py" contains implementation of neural network using 'TensorFlow 2.0'


In addition, a new file has been added:

"MNIST_classification_tensorflow_2_hardcoded.py" contains implementation of a neural network for classification of MNIST dataset using a neural network programmed from scratch using TensorFlow 2.0
