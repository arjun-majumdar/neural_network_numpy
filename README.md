# neural_network_numpy
Implementation of a neural network from scratch using numpy Python package

A simple neural network having one hidden layer for binary classification of images of cats and dogs.
Coded completely using numpy (1.17.3) and Python (3.7.4).

The hidden layer uses the following as it's activation function: either hyperbolic tangent function or ReLU function.
The output layer uses sigmoid activation function for performing binary classification.
